# Data Set:
This dataset appears to be a record of traffic crashes, including details like crash date, time, location, and contributing factors. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage and provides data that could be used for traffic safety analysis.
# Questions:
1. In 2023, what was the total number of collisions that occurred during each hour of the day across the boroughs with the 3 highest number of collisions, and how did this distribution differ for the causes of driver inattention, backing unsafely, failure to yield the right-of-way, and following too closely?

2. Is there a statistically significant correlation between the time of day and the likelihood of "drunk driving" being a contributing factor in crashes, with a particular focus on nighttime hours?
