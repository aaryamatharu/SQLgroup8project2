# Data Set:
This data set was obtained from the US Data Government Website, and the publisher of the dataset is The City of New York. This dataset is a record of traffic crashes, including details like crash date, time, location, and contributing factors. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police-reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage and provides data that could be used for traffic safety analysis. This dataset could be used to analyze trends in traffic accidents, identify high-risk locations, and inform safety measures.

# Questions:
**1. In 2023, what was the total number of collisions that occurred during each hour of the day across the boroughs with the 3 highest number of collisions, and how did this distribution differ for the causes of driver inattention, backing unsafely, failure to yield the right-of-way, and following too closely?**

Importance: Understanding the hourly distribution of collisions can inform targeted interventions such as deploying traffic enforcement or awareness campaigns during high-risk hours. Examining specific causes—driver inattention, backing unsafely, failure to yield, and following too closely—helps identify behavioral patterns that lead to collisions, enabling borough-specific and cause-specific safety strategies. This is socially significant as it can reduce injuries, fatalities, and economic losses caused by preventable crashes.


**2. Is there a statistically significant correlation between the time of day and the likelihood of "drunk driving" being a contributing factor in crashes, with a particular focus on nighttime hours?**

Importance: Drunk driving is a major public safety concern, often linked to nighttime hours. Analyzing whether there is a statistically significant correlation between time of day and drunk driving likelihood can guide law enforcement and public health efforts, such as the timing of DUI checkpoints or awareness campaigns. Addressing this issue is culturally critical to reducing the stigma around drunk driving and improving roadway safety for all.
